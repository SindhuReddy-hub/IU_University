import os
from google.colab import drive

# 1. Unmount the drive if it's already mounted (optional, but good practice)
# if os.path.isdir('/content/drive'):
#     drive.flush_and_unmount()

# 2. Forcibly remove the existing directory (this is the key fix)
# The '-rf' flag means recursively (r) and forcibly (f) delete the directory and its contents.
!rm -rf /content/drive

# 3. Remount the drive
drive.mount('/content/drive', force_remount=True)
